## Overview

CCIHS (Cross-Chain Interoperability Hooks for Solana) is a middleware solution that simplifies and extends cross-chain development on Solana. It offers a unified API for multiple protocols, featuring a flexible hook system for custom logic injection. This architecture enables advanced use cases and optimizes for Solana's high-performance environment, making cross-chain development more accessible and powerful. In an increasingly interconnected blockchain ecosystem, CCIHS serves as a crucial transport network interface, enabling seamless interaction between Solana and other blockchain networks and thereby aims to revolutionize cross-chain communication for Solana-based applications.

## Problem with Cross chain Communication in Solana

Solana developers face significant challenges when creating applications that need to communicate with other blockchains. The process is complex, time-consuming, and prone to errors, also there is a lack of standardization in cross chain operations, so for instance it is hard to make a Wormhole Solana app interact with a LayerZero Solana app, as there is no unified interface for multiple cross-chain protocols. 

## Solution CCIHS offers

CCIHS is a Rust-based package that serves as a middleware layer for cross-chain development on Solana. At its core, CCIHS provides a robust and flexible framework that abstracts the complexities of cross-chain messaging. It leverages Solana's high-performance architecture while offering a standardized interface for interacting with various cross-chain protocols. This approach not only simplifies development but also future-proofs applications against changes in underlying cross-chain technologies. At the heart of CCIHS is our flexible hook system, which allows developers to inject custom logic at crucial points in the message lifecycle. Whether you need custom validation, logging, or complex transformations, our hook system makes it possible without altering the core code. This architecture enables advanced use cases while optimizing for Solana's high-performance environment.

## Architecture

## Installation (still in development so won't work for now)

Add CCIHS to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ccihs = "0.1.0"
```

## Quick Start

Here's a comprehensive example of how to use CCIHS to set up a cross-chain communication system with custom hooks:

```rust
use ccihs::{
    CCIHSConfig, CCIHSAPI, CrossChainMessage, ChainId, ProtocolType,
    hooks::{HookType, ValidationHook, LoggingHook, EncryptionHook},
};

fn main() -> CCIHSResult<()> {
    // Step 1: Initialize CCIHS with a custom configuration
    let config = CCIHSConfig::new()
        .with_default_protocol(ProtocolType::Wormhole)
        .with_supported_chains(vec![ChainId::Solana, ChainId::Ethereum]);
    let mut ccihs = CCIHSAPI::new(config)?;

    // Step 2: Add custom hooks
    ccihs.add_hook(HookType::PreDispatch, Box::new(ValidationHook::new(1024))); // Max payload size of 1024 bytes
    ccihs.add_hook(HookType::PostDispatch, Box::new(LoggingHook::new()));
    ccihs.add_hook(HookType::PreExecution, Box::new(EncryptionHook::new([0u8; 32]))); // Example encryption key

    // Step 3: Create a cross-chain message
    let mut message = CrossChainMessage::new(
        ChainId::Solana,
        ChainId::Ethereum,
        "sender_address".to_string(),
        "recipient_address".to_string(),
        vec![1, 2, 3, 4], // Example payload
    );

    // Step 4: Send the message
    match ccihs.send_message(&mut message) {
        Ok(_) => println!("Message sent successfully"),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to send message: {}", e),
    }

    // Step 5: (Optional) Change the default protocol
    ccihs.set_default_protocol(ProtocolType::LayerZero)?;

    // Step 6: (Optional) Update configuration
    let new_config = CCIHSConfig::new()
        .with_default_protocol(ProtocolType::LayerZero)
        .with_supported_chains(vec![ChainId::Solana, ChainId::Ethereum, ChainId::Avalanche]);
    ccihs.update_config(new_config)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

This example demonstrates:

1. Initializing CCIHS with a custom configuration.
2. Adding custom hooks for validation, logging, and encryption.
3. Creating and sending a cross-chain message.
4. Changing the default protocol (e.g., from Wormhole to LayerZero).
